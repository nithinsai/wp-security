It is your responsibility to care about your website. Read this full article if you want to secure your WordPress site from the bad guys.



WordPress is being monitored by hundred of its developers from time to time for making it more secure. 
We are going to give you the best suggestions to make your WordPress site secure.

(A) Login Page Security
1. Change the Login Page URL:


Everyone knows the WordPress login URL is wp-admin or wp-admin.php so hackers can easily start brute force attacks on your WordPress website.
The best solution for this is to change the login URL of your WordPress website. You can use WPS Hide Login plugin to change the login URL.

2. Use Strong Password:


Keeping strong password for your website is as much important as much your ATM card PIN number. 
You must change your passwords on regular basis. Never use any common word in your passwords. Always mix your passwords with Upper case, lower case, special characters, and numbers. You can also use any good password generator site for generating the strong password.

3. Use 2-Factor Authentication


Using 2-factor authentication for your website login page is one of the best things that you can do to secure your WordPress site.
It helps your site from the brute force attacks. Using 2-factor authentication takes some time on your end but believe me, it really helps to secure your website. 
If you are using 2-factor authentication then before login it will ask you to answer a security question and you have to answer or it will send a code to your mobile and you have to verify that code on the login page. 
You can use Google Authenticator for 2-factor authentication (2FA).

4. Change the Login username:


Most of the people keep their login username as ADMIN but this in this way you are helping to hackers for the brute force attacks. 
Always keep the unpredictable usernames and better I will suggest you use Email ID instead of username and it is tough to predict for the hackers. You can use Email Login plugin and it will help you to log in with your email ID.

5. Limit Login Attempts:


Hackers try to login to your WordPress site many times by using different combinations of passwords and usernames and limiting the login attempts will help you to secure your WordPress website from them.
By default, 
WordPress allows to log in multiple times but it is not good for the safety of your website. You can use Login LockDown to set the limit of login attempts.

6. Always Keep Back up of Your Site:


Keeping back up of your WordPress website is a very smart move that you should make. In this world nothing is safe and keeping our website, data back up is very important in case you fall into the hackers trap. You can use WordPress Backup to Dropbox for keeping the backup of your website in a simple way.

7. Set Strong Password for the Database:


Always set a strong password for your database and as I mentioned above, always mix upper case, lower case, special case and numbers in your password. You can use any online password generator also to generate a very strong password.

8. Update Regularly:


Time to time WordPress software, Themes and Plugins release their updated versions so you must update everything to be on the safe side. The developers update the WordPress, themes, and plugins to fix the bugs and to secure the software. In most of the cases, if you don’t update your WordPress site on regular basis, 
hackers may attack our site by exploiting the bugs. 
Hackers are more active than you and they wait for your one wrong move so they can attack your WordPress website so it is best practice to keep your WordPress site updated.

9. Never Use Premium Themes and Plugins for FREE:


I can understand in the starting phase of your blogging career you may not want to invest on premium themes and plugins but using premium themes and plugins for free can put your site in danger because no one is going to give you premium products for free without any benefits. 
I can also understand you are on a tight budget but something is better than nothing. This is the beauty of WordPress that you can get all the features in free plugins and themes and if you are not getting that features for free then better buy instead of using free themes and plugins.

Most of the premium themes that are available for free on Internet are nulled and come with malicious codes that are harmful to your website. It can be the biggest mistake of your blogging career to use nulled themes and plugins on WordPress site.

You can use VirusTotal to scan the themes and plugins file. You can use Theme Authenticity Checker plugin to check the authenticity of your themes.

10. Use Security Plugins:


Using security plugins are very important to your websites as they work like an active army for the security of your WordPress website. There are many free and paid security plugins are available for the WordPress.
I will suggest using WordFence, Sucuri and Security Ninja to your WordPress site to make it more secure.

11. Delete Inactive Themes and Plugins:
Always delete the inactive themes and plugins from the WordPress site.
It will also affect the speed of your website so better keep them out of your lawn.

12. Logout automatically Idle Users:


Sometimes we forget to log out or go to grab a cup of coffee in our office and anyone can misuse this time to change any details of your sites.
Using Idle User Logout can help to log out the session automatically for the idle users.

13. Use SSL for WordPress Site:


Always use SSL certificate on your websites to increase the trust of users and to secure your website. 
Most of the hosting companies give the free SSL certificates for your website. SSL ensures that the data between your site and server is secure and it helps the save your site from the hackers. Google also loves the sites with SSL certificates and ranks them higher than the non-SSL certificate sites. You can use Let’s Encrypt to get the Free SSL certificate for your website and it will change the web address of your website from HTTP to HTTPS. After getting SSL certificate you can also use Really Simple SSL plugin to make sure that your site always opens in HTTPS mode.

14. Always Keep Track of Dashboard Activity:


If you have many users on your WordPress website then you must keep track of the activities happening on your website.
Keeping track of the activity is a good idea to check if any wrong activities are happening by any user on your website. You can use WP Security Audit Log to keep track of your WordPress site activities.

(C) Securing The Hosting:
15. Choosing the Right Hosting Company:



Almost each and every hosting company claims that they have good safe and secure environment for WordPress sites but we have to choose the hosting service wisely. 
I will suggest you choose some good hosting services like Bluehost and A2 Hosting. Before buying any hosting for your WordPress website you must check some details like:

Server Uptime
SSD Disk Space
Bandwidth
MySQL Database
Daily Backups
Free cPanel Migration
PHP Versions
Git version

MoneyBack Policy


16. Secure the wp-config.php File:
Wp-config.php holds some very crucial information about your site and protecting this file is too much important for the safety of your WordPress site. 
If this file is accessible to the hackers then they can hack your site easily but we have to hide this file from the reach of the hackers.
To secure this file you just have to move this file to a higher level than the root directory.

17. Lock File Editing:


If you have a multi-user website and if any of the users have admin level access to your website then they can easily modify any files of your website including themes and plugins. 
If you disallow the file editing then no one can edit any file on your website and your website can be saved from the harm. At the end of the wp-config.php file add:
